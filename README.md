## flomo-with-text-formatting
Add some markdown/org-mode styling to memos in the Flomo web app, using the MutationObserver api.
Right now styles code blocks (```), inline clode (`), and org-mode style titles (#+TITLE:)

## hide-wp-admin-bar
Hides the Wordpress admin bar, but can double click or tab into it to make it visible.
Doesn't remove the margin added in to accommodate it, but changes the background color of the page to match (my specific) browser colour.
